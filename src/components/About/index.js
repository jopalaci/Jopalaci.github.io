            A motivated programmer who developed his interest in Computer
            Science and Software Development over the years. I enjoy taking on
            challenges and developing beautiful and responsive products. I'm a
            first-gen recent graduate from the University of California, Santa
            Cruz, where I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.
            During that time, I picked up a variety of languages and skills from
            working on school projects or personal endeavors. Although I
            primarily focus on front-end development, I've have experience with
            databases and machine learning, and I can pick up new technologies
            fairly quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born and raised in San Jose, California but I'm currently based in
            Las Vegas, Nevada.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my professional and academic interests, I'm passionate
            about learning new pour-over coffee brewing methods, playing FPS
            shooters, reading thriller books, <strike>gambling</strike>{' '}
            investing in options-trading, and browsing new music. Specifically
            trance, metal, or jazz.
            <br />
            <p>
              I also love languages. Recently I've been learning French in my
              free time so that I can enhance my experience traveling to places
              like France, Qu√©bec or Switzerland.
